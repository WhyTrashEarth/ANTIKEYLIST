# ANTIKEYLIST
The Anti Key List is an open-source project dedicated to improving accessibility and usability by creating a character set that eliminates commonly confused characters. Our goal is to reduce errors in key inputs, password entries, and other text-based interactions where misinterpreted characters can cause frustration or inefficiency.
