# Anti Key List

## Purpose

The **Anti Key List** is a project designed to enhance user experience and accessibility by creating a character set that avoids commonly confused or misinterpreted characters. This initiative is particularly beneficial for individuals with vision impairments, people working in environments where accuracy is crucial, and anyone who has ever struggled with misreading or mistyping characters. By reducing the potential for errors in character interpretation, the Anti Key List aims to make digital interactions smoother, more reliable, and more inclusive.

## Why This Matters

In a world increasingly reliant on digital communication and secure data entry, even small errors can have significant consequences. The Anti Key List addresses this by excluding characters that are often confused with one another, such as `O`, `0`, `1`, `l`, `I`, and others. This simple yet effective approach can prevent mistakes in scenarios like password entry, product key redemption, and secure code generation.

## How It Works

The Anti Key List provides a pre-defined set of "approved" characters that can be used in various applications, from web forms to software key generation. The project includes a script written in Python, which developers can easily integrate into their systems. The script generates random keys or validates input, ensuring that only the approved characters are used.
